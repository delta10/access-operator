# Access operator

This project uses [Kubebuilder](https://kubebuilder.io/) to implement a Kubernetes operator that manages access to databases for different applications.


## Setup
First make sure you have [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation) installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the Kubebuilder website to set it up.

If you're running windows use WSL.
